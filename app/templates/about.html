    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>The Guild Tutor Exchange is an online platform, operated by the UWA Student Guild, that allows students to find a free tutor for any unit they need assistance in. Students may also volunteer to provide tutoring in units they have completed, and the time they spend tutoring can be recognised on their transcript. The service has been relaunched in 2017 with a new web app, and is open to all UWA students.</p>
